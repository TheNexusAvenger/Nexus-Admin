# Nexus Admin API
## Types
Nexus Admin is intended to be loaded when the game
starts. This means no types are shown in Studio.
To get around this, it is recommended to have
a copy of the [Types](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Admin/blob/master/src/Types.lua)
script. There are no dependencies and can be
stored anywhere in the game.

## Fetching The API
Nexus Admin's API is fetched differently on the client
and the server.
```lua
local NexusAdminTypes = require(...)

--Server
local NexusAdminApi = require(game:GetService("ServerScriptService"):WaitForChild("NexusAdmin")) :: NexusAdminTypes.NexusAdminApiServer
while not NexusAdminApi:GetAdminLoaded() do
    task.wait()
end

--Client
local NexusAdminApi = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("NexusAdminClient")) :: NexusAdminTypes.NexusAdminApiClient
```

## API Properties
- `AdminItemContainer: Folder`: Folder in `Workspace`
  that will be cleared with the `clear` command.
- `Cmdr: Cmdr`: Raw Cmdr API used by Nexus Admin.
- `CmdrVersion: string`: String-based version of Cmdr
  that Nexus Admin is using.
- `CommandData: {[any]: any}`: Table intended for
  commands to store persistent data or expose APIs. While
  it is used for included commands, no APIs are exposed
  that are guarenteed to be maintained long-term.
- `EventContainer: Folder`: Folder intended for storing
  `RemoteEvent`s and `RemoteFunction`s.
- `Version: string`: String-based version of Nexus Admin.
- `VersionNumberId: number`: Major and minor version
  of Nexus Admin in the form of a number. Intended to
  check compatibility of versions.

See [Nexus Feature Flag's docs](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Feature-Flags/blob/master/docs/usage.md).

### `Filter`
#### `Filter:EscapeRichText(String: string): string`
Escapes a string for use with rich text.

#### `Filter:FilterString(String: string, PlayerFrom: Player, PlayerTo: Player?): string` *(Server-Only)*
Filters a string from a player. A destination player can be optionally
specified to filter for that specific player.

### `Filter:FilterStringForPlayers(String: string, PlayerFrom: Player, PlayersTo: {Player}) -> {[Player]: string}` *(Server-Only)*
Filters a string individually for a set of players. The returned
table is the strings to use for the target players.

### `Logs` *(Server-Only)*
`Logs` is a singleton instance of `NexusAdminTypes.Logs`
that stores the history of commands being ran. For creating
a new instance of `Logs`, require the module instead.

```lua
local NexusAdminTypes = require(...)
local Logs = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("NexusAdminClient"):WaitForChid("Common"):WaitForChild("Logs")) :: NexusAdminTypes.Logs

local MyLogs = Logs.new()
```

Event for a log entry being added.

#### `Logs:GetLogs(): {any}`
Returns the current entriese of the logs.

### `Logs:Add(Log: any): ()`
Adds a log entry.

### `Logs:Destroy(): ()`

the `LogsRegistry` can be used to store logs.

#### `LogsRegistry:GetLogs(LogName: string): Logs`
Returns the logs for a given name. The first time this is called on
the client will yield to fetch the initial entries. An error will
be thrown on the client if the admin level of the player is not
high enough for the logs.

#### `LogsRegistry:RegisterLogs(LogName: string, Logs: Logs, MinimumAdminLevel: number): ()`
Registers logs to be replicated to clients. A minimum admin level
must be given to restrict which players can read the logs. An error
will be thrown is duplicate log names are used.

### `Messages`
#### `Messages:DisplayHint(Message: string, DisplayTime: number?): ()` *Client-Only*

`Types` is a table used for Cmdr types to expose
additional APIs. Anything can add to it.

#### `Types.NexusAdminPlayers:RegisterPatternShortHand(Name:  Name: string | {string}, Callback: (Text: string, Executor: Player, Players: {Player}) -> ({Player})): ()`

player arguments. In the callback to parse players, `Text`
is the input text to parse, `Executor` is the player executing
the command, and `Players` is the players to filter though.
For the short hand to apply, it must match the pattern of
the short hand.

#### `Types.NexusAdminPlayers:RegisterShortHand(Name:  Name: string | {string}, Callback: (Text: string, Executor: Player, Players: {Player}) -> ({Player})): ()`
Registers a short hand or list of short hands for parsing
player arguments. In the callback to parse players, `Text`
is the input text to parse, `Executor` is the player executing
the command, and `Players` is the players to filter though.
For the short hand to apply, it must match the text exactly
ignoring case.

### `Registry`
#### `Registry:AddEnumType(Name: string, Options: {string}): ()`
Adds an enum type for commands to use where the string is the
name of the type and the options are the values the enum can have.
A version of that enum with the name will be registered as a type
to return a single value while the name with an `"s"` appended
will be registered to return multiple values.

`AddEnumType` can be re-ran with the same name to update the values.
